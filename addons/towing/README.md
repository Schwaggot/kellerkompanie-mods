## keko_towing
This mod is a customized version of Advanced Towing by Duda (http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=30575). It can be now enabled/disabled per mission using CBA settings and the interactions are made using ACE3 instead auf mouse scroll menu.
Most code here does not belong to me and is only slightly adjusted, the original version by Duda can be found here https://github.com/sethduda/AdvancedTowing
